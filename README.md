# Seth Holloway's Résumés

Tracking a few different approaches that I have taken to resumes.

## Resumes

A responsive HTML resume.

An HTML resume laid out as a timeline moving from left-to-right.

The World of Warcraft character builder style resume that shows skills in two broad areas. In general, the lower entries should be more difficult than the higher entries.

My attempt at a LaTeX template.
