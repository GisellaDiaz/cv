# Seth Holloway's Résumés

Tracking a few different approaches that I have taken to resumes.

## Resumes

A [responsive HTML resume](http://www.sethholloway.com/resume.html).

An HTML [resume laid out as a timeline](http://www.sethholloway.com/timelineResume.html) moving from left-to-right.

[The World of Warcraft character builder style resume](http://sethholloway.com/alternativeResume.html) that shows skills in two broad areas. In general, the lower entries should be more difficult than the higher entries.

My [LaTeX template](http://sethholloway.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/SethHollowayResume1.pdf).

## Notes

Feel free to use the ideas in your own resume.

I have not kept my resume particularly up-to-date, so the different formats may have wildly different data. [My LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/sethholloway) is probably the most up-to-date despite the hours I've spent developing nice-looking, interesting resumes.
