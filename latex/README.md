# Seth Holloway's LaTeX resume

On [MTV Cribs, Jermaine Dupri said](http://articles.latimes.com/2001/oct/24/entertainment/ca-60917), "you're not a big dog unless you've got a Bentley!" Well, I say you're not a big dog unless you've got a LaTeX resume. What!

In my PhD years, I got familiar with LaTeX. It's not without its faults, but it is awesome for creating professional looking text. I wanted a professional looking resume, so I created a LaTeX resume. It looks nice, but it is a chore to maintain.

## Aside

Mike Doughty mentions Jermaine Dupri's quote in track #9 of [Smofe + Smang: Life in Minneapolis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smofe_%2B_Smang:_Live_in_Minneapolis) and says that you're not a big dog unless you have a bucket of shoes in your foyer. I have that too. What!
