# RPG Character Builder Resume

Have you ever created a character for an RPG? I've seen them for everything from pen and paper games like D&D to modern computer games like WoW. This resume is my interpretation of my own "character progression."

## History
When I created this, I had not seen another resume in this style. I was inspired by World of Warcraft character builders in the time before talents were simpified. At the time, a player had 51 points to allocate across three different talent trees. You had to place five points in each row before you could proceed. To add more depth some talents also required prerequisite talents; for example, you might need to grab shield proficiency before you could get tower shield proficiency.

Originally I had three "trees" and an expertise level for each talent. The trees were something like people skills, academic skills, and industry skills, but that felt too arbitrary. I tried people skills, web skills, and general skills, but that was still unsatisfying. Ultimately, I settled on technical skills and teamwork. Talent points were omitted, but I think they'd be a nice addition if people could agree on a subset of skills and their relative difficulties to attain. If I had more time, I'd try to define the generic skillset and get some buy-in. I'd also like to create a site to create similar resumes for visitors. To accomodate other fields, you could create new trees. A user would simply select their trees and add their proficiency in each of the skills.

## Looks

The page could look a lot better. I put enough effort in to make it look okay, but it's very minimal. If I had more time, I'd improve font and typography, create my own icons, and standardize colors.

## Performance

I've tried to optimize the page or page speed, but there are several things left to do--mostly with  proper HTTP and web server settings. 

It would also be wise to move images to a CDN. 

I love jQuery, but 78kb of library is overkill for a page this simple.
